# Phantom-Botnet
A simple botnet template that routes through a simple proxy network to ddos.

# THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

## THIS IS UNFINISHED, AND AN OLD PROJECT, AND IT MAY TAKE A WHILE TO WRITE SOME CODE TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL.


This botnet uses a simple command framework transmitted through a socket to an ip logged onto a webapi (didnt code the web api, you can easily make one of your own that matches the syntax in the program) and makes it initiate an attack.

This source code has the exploit code for the bot, and the client code for the attacker.

Credits to the library I used (i forgot where i got it from)
