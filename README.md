## THIS MAY NOT WORK, AS IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED BY ME, IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE JUST MAKE A PULL REQUEST AND SEND A FIX.


This botnet uses a simple command framework transmitted through a socket to an ip logged onto a webapi (didnt code the web api, you can easily make one of your own that matches the syntax in the program) and makes it initiate an attack.

This source code has the exploit code for the bot, and the client code for the attacker.

Credits to the library I used (i forgot where i got it from)
